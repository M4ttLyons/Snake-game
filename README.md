# Portfolio Website
This is the second project I completed. This is built with c++ and runs in the command line.

## Live Demo
Download both the .cpp and .hpp file, compile, and then run the executable.

## Learning Outcomes
This project gave me a few valuable learning experiences:
* Introduction to using C++ in practice
* Basic OOP with classes in C++
* Taking keyboard input from a user in C++
